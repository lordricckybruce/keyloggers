A **keylogger** (short for **key recorder**) is a type of surveillance software or hardware device that secretly records the keystrokes typed on a computer or mobile device. Keyloggers can capture everything typed, including sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages, making them a major security threat.

### Types of Keyloggers:
1. **Software Keyloggers**: 
   - These are programs installed on a device to monitor and record keystrokes. They can operate in the background without the userâ€™s knowledge and can be difficult to detect by standard antivirus software.
   - Some software keyloggers are designed for legitimate purposes (e.g., parental control or employee monitoring), but most are used maliciously for cybercrime.
   
2. **Hardware Keyloggers**: 
   - These are physical devices plugged between a computer's keyboard and the system. They record keystrokes directly from the hardware level and are harder to detect.
   - They can be small devices that are discreetly inserted into the USB port or the keyboard cable.

### How Keyloggers Work:
- **Recording Keystrokes**: Keyloggers intercept each key press and store this data locally or send it over a network to a remote server.
- **Data Storage**: The recorded data can be saved in log files, often encrypted, to avoid detection.
- **Sending Data**: Some keyloggers send captured data to a remote attacker, usually via email or other means, allowing hackers to gather sensitive information from the victim's device.

### Risks of Keyloggers:
- **Privacy Invasion**: Keyloggers can compromise personal privacy by capturing everything typed, including passwords, private messages, and credit card information.
- **Identity Theft**: The stolen information can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or hacking into personal accounts.
- **Data Theft**: Keyloggers can lead to the theft of sensitive company or client data, which is especially dangerous in the context of corporate espionage or government hacking.

### Prevention Measures:
- **Use Anti-Keylogger Software**: Specialized tools that can detect and block keyloggers.
- **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly updating your operating system and software reduces the chances of malware infections.
- **Use On-Screen Keyboards**: Some software keyloggers cannot capture keystrokes entered using on-screen keyboards.
- **Physical Security**: For hardware keyloggers, maintaining physical control over your devices can help prevent tampering.
- **Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive data can protect it even if a keylogger is present.

Keyloggers are powerful tools in the hands of cybercriminals but can also be used in legitimate ways, like parental controls and employee monitoring, if done transparently and with consent.
